Configuration for the TacCap-Gripper handheld data-collection device.

Hardware:
- TacCap-Gripper handheld unit (XenseRobotics): motor-driven jaw, two
  embedded visuotactile sensors, wrist UVC camera, encoder, IMU.
  Driven by the ``xense.taccap`` SDK (``taccap-gripper`` PyPI package).
- Pico4 Ultra independent motion tracker physically mounted on top to
  provide 6-DoF pose. Reached via ``xensevr_pc_service_sdk``.

**Serial auto-discovery.** The gripper, its two tactile sensors and its wrist
camera are scanned from the connected hardware and matched by the Xense serial
rule (odd sequence → left, even → right; patch ``m`` → leader, ``s`` →
follower) — no serials are listed here (see ``serial_discovery.py``). With
both grippers connected, set ``side`` to pick one; otherwise the single connected
gripper is used. A non-conforming serial raises a clear error.

Recorded pose frame: our world frame (X forward away from base, Y left,
Z up, gravity-aligned) — ``Pico4TrackerReader`` applies the same Pico→world
remap the controller uses. The world origin is the headset position at
Unity-app launch time.

    gripper exists. It is here because a rig whose cameras will not all open is
    hard to reason about, and being able to take the four tactile streams out
    (or, with the wrist flags, take the wrist streams out) turns "something
    fails" into an arithmetic question about USB isochronous budget — one
    bus, 480 Mbit/s, ~384 of it available. See the README's troubleshooting
    section.

    Prefer this over setting ``expected_tactiles_per_side`` to 0: the count says

    problem for a loop with single-digit milliseconds of headroom.

    The firmware divides a 1 kHz tick, so only divisors of 1000 arrive exactly
    (the SDK warns when it rounds). 100 is its default and gives a jaw reading

    fed the recorded ``tactile_{left,right}``. Any *other* type is published under
