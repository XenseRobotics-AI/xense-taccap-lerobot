Tracker → EE rigid transform for the TacCap-Gripper.

The Pico4 tracker is bolted to the gripper, so what the tracker reports is the
*tracker's* pose, not the end effector we actually want to record. This module owns the
constant rigid offset between the two, for both sides, and is the single place
the numbers live.

Frames
------
``Pico4TrackerReader`` already emits **world-frame** poses (X forward, Y left,
Z up, gravity-aligned) and then right-multiplies the offset::

    T_world_ee = T_world_tracker @ X  # tracker.py

so ``X`` is body-fixed: it rides along with the gripper and is valid at any
runtime orientation. That is why the operator may start a UMI session with the
gripper pointing anywhere.

Where the numbers come from
---------------------------
A SolidWorks macro reads the assembly's ``Tracker frame`` and ``EE frame``
coordinate systems and reports ``^Tracker T_EE`` directly — EE expressed in the
tracker frame, which is exactly the factor above. Both sides are measured; the
left is **not** derived by mirroring (see below).

Cross-checked against the standalone measurement in ``media/right_eef_tcp.jpg``
(the same two frames, reported in world axes at the reference pose where the EE
frame is aligned to world, so ``R_world_ee = I``)::

    delta_world  ==  R_tracker_eeᵀ · t_tracker_ee
    predicted (179.266402, -29.203296, -71.650795) mm
    screenshot  (179.266402, -29.203296, -71.650795) mm      agree to 0.000 mm

That also settles the screenshot's sign question: its Y and Z really are
negative, as the macro reports independently.

Side symmetry — checked, not assumed
------------------------------------
The two sides are near-mirrors about the XZ plane (``y → −y``) but not exactly:

* rotation agrees with the mirror to **0.03°**
* translation differs by **1.27 mm** (``|t|`` 195.25 mm right vs 194.09 left)

So both sides carry their own measured values and :func:`mirror_xz` is kept only
as a consistency check. Deriving one side from the other would bake in that
1.27 mm.

The ``G`` re-basing — settled, no re-base needed
-----------------------------------------------
``tracker.py`` builds the world pose by conjugation, ``T = G · T · Gᵀ`` with
``G = PICO_TO_WORLD_R``, which re-expresses the reference frame **and re-labels
the tracker's own body axes**. So the CAD ``Tracker frame`` either matches that
re-labelled convention (use the values as-is) or the device's physical datum (a
further ``G`` first). The two land the EE 168 mm apart, 51° off each other, and
both at the right 195 mm from the tracker — so the numbers alone cannot tell
them apart, only looking at the drawn frames can.

**Checked on hardware (2026-08-02): as-is is correct.** The EE frame sits at the
two-finger midpoint in the Rerun ``/world`` view, so ``APPLY_G_REBASE`` stays
``False``. This is a property of the CAD file, not of a session — it does not
need re-checking unless the assembly's coordinate systems are redrawn.
