Configuration for the bimanual TacCap-Gripper handheld data-collection rig.

Two independent TacCap-Gripper units (left + right), each = a motor-driven jaw
(encoder read-only), two embedded visuotactile sensors, a wrist UVC camera, an
IMU, plus a Pico4 Ultra motion tracker mounted on top for 6-DoF pose.

**Serial auto-discovery.** You no longer list device serials. The robot scans the
connected hardware at construct/connect time and assigns each gripper, tactile
sensor and wrist camera to ``left``/``right`` by the Xense serial rule (odd
sequence → left, even → right; patch ``m`` → leader, ``s`` → follower). See ``serial_discovery.py``. A serial that does not conform, or a side
whose hardware is missing/duplicated, raises a clear error so the config and the
physical serials can never drift out of alignment.

The Pico4 motion tracker is **also auto-discovered**: when ``enable_tracker`` is on,
the connected trackers are enumerated from the XenseVR PC service at startup and
assigned to ``left``/``right`` by the Pico serial rule (second-to-last digit odd →
left, even → right; e.g. ``PC2310MLL3200496G`` → ``6`` → right). A bimanual rig
requires one tracker per side; a missing / duplicate / malformed tracker raises a
clear error. Set ``enable_tracker=false`` to record tactile + gripper only.

To bypass the tracker side rule (e.g. a tracker whose serial does not follow it),
set ``left_tracker_serial`` / ``right_tracker_serial`` — a pinned side uses the
given serial verbatim and never touches enumeration; un-pinned sides still
auto-discover by rule.
